2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,375
[Aang] Hello?

3
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,208
Hello?

4
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,333
Anybody there?

5
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,167
There's been a mistake!
The fires weren't my fault!

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,458
And neither was the fight!

7
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,792
[Iroh] Save your voice.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,000
Earth Kingdom soldiers
aren't particularly tolerant,

9
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,417
even under the best of circumstances.

10
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:37,875
And these are most definitely
not the best of circumstances.

11
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,208
General Iroh.

12
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,042
It's good to see you, young Avatar.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,167
And Zuko?

14
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,042
They capture him too?

15
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:50,083
I hope not. With any luck, he's probably
halfway back to his ship by now.

16
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,792
This is all his fault.

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,833
He started the fight
and left you behind and ran away.

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,708
I'm really starting to see
what kind of person he is.

19
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:00,042
I doubt that.

20
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,333
What do you think will happen to us?

21
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:03,625
[man screams]

22
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,292
I don't know.

23
00:01:09,042 --> 00:01:10,042
But in my experience,

24
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,917
the Earthbenders aren't exactly kind
to their fallen foes.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
[suspenseful music swells]

26
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,625
[Sokka] Is it true?

27
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,292
Were you working with the enemy?

28
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,000
It's complicated.

29
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,417
No, it's not. It's a simple question.
Were you helping the Firebenders?

30
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,458
[somber music playing]

31
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:40,958
Yes.

32
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,917
Teo.

33
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,458
I was trying to protect you.

34
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,625
The Firebenders said
that they would kill us

35
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,417
and then they'd attack the city
if I didn't cooperate.

36
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:59,292
The only reason Omashu has been left alone
is because of whatever service I provided.

37
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,542
Service? Is that what you call
giving weapons to the enemy?

38
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:05,208
Weapons? No.
No, no, no, no, just minor designs.

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,875
Nothing of any value in war.

40
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,458
Anything can be turned into a weapon
in the wrong hands.

41
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,333
Especially with the Fire Nation.

42
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,667
Sokka.

43
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
You know what it means
to make hard choices.

44
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,708
Your father had to leave your family
to go to war,

45
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:24,542
leaving you, just a boy, in charge.

46
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,250
We do what we must

47
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,542
to survive.

48
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,125
We compromise

49
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,167
just enough to get by.

50
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,792
My father would've never done
what you did.

51

[door opens, closes]

52
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,000
I found him.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,708
Aang's in prison.

[boy] Aang!

Hey, Aang!

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,292
Oh, hey, Bumi. How's training going?

63
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,625
I'm doing all right with my forms,
but shaping is hard.

64
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,875
What are you talking about?
Looks exactly like a sky bison.

65
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,958
It's supposed to be a badgermole.

66
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,542
You sure? [chuckles]

67
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,333
[laughing and snorting]

68
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:02,208
There's nothing like earthbending masonry.

69
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,500
No seams.

70
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:08,000
That's what makes their cities a wonder.

71
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:12,250
Awe-inspiring palaces,
gravity-defying towers.

72
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:15,500
Impenetrable prisons.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,333
I like the parts of Omashu
that aren't so depressing.

74
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,000
Hmm. Cities are like people.

75
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,917
They always have their dark sides.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,583
Seems pretty dark
on all the sides these days.

77
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,750
Yeah, what happened here
happened the world over.

78
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,750
That's what a century of war will do.

79
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,875
A war started by the Fire Nation.

80
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,208
- And a war the Fire Nation could end.
- [Iroh] Hmm.

81
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,417
If it were only that simple.

82
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:45,000
My brother, the Fire Lord,
sees things through only one lens,

83
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,750
victory or defeat.

84
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,958
Nothing else matters.

85
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Not even the loved ones
lost along the way.

86
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,667
[Aang] That's why Zuko's
so hot to catch me?

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,750
So he can win this war for his dad?

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,625
Zuko's victory lies not in winning the war

89
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,375
but in winning his life back.

90
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,875
You could show him this isn't the way.
He'll listen to you.

91
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,958
I mean, he owes you that much.

92
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,583
On the contrary,

93
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,833
it is I who owe him.

94
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:30,750
Far more than I can ever repay.

95
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,042
Impossible!

96
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,250
Omashu's prison is deep in the heart
of the mountain surrounded by solid rock.

97
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,333
The only way in or out
is through the palace.

98
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,167
I'm sorry. The Avatar is lost.

99
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,875
We're not leaving Aang.

100
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,333
You can get us into the palace.

101
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,375
Not after today. I'm sorry. I can't.

102
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,000
What about the tunnels?

103
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,125
[dramatic music playing]

104
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,208
Tunnels?

105
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,375
The secret tunnels
hidden under the mountain.

106
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,750
It's said that the founders of the city
used them to meet without anyone knowing.

107
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,750
- A fairy tale.
- You told me you've seen them.

108
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,875
Unless that was a lie too.

109
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,625
Yes, there are tunnels,
but they're unstable.

110
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Those who go in never come out.

111
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:23,292
If you believe the tales,
vengeful spirits guard the passages.

112
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,375
So not just secret tunnels.

113
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,542
Secret haunted tunnels?

114
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,684
Even if I could figure out a way
to get them through the tunnels,

115
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,629
there's nothing
I can do about the palace guards.

116
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,500
We'll worry about that.
Just help us get inside.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,625
[Aang] Where are you taking him?

118
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
[guard] To the Pit.

119
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:48,458
[Aang] The Pit?

120
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,500
An Earth Kingdom labor camp
for prisoners of war.

121
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,167
No one who's been sent there
has ever been heard from again.

122
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,625
[suspenseful music playing]

123
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,917
You… you're not as lucky.

124
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,167
You're going to see the king.

125
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,958
[bang on door]

126
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,958
These maps don't make any sense.
This one says to travel east.

127
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,583
This one shows a path due south.

128
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:25,542
And this one… spirals straight up.

129
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,167
Um… hmm…

130
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,667
What is it?

131
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:36,542
It's my Fire Nation contact.

132
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,500
Tell him you'll meet him.

133
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:44,518
Then go to the Earth Kingdom generals
and let them know they can set a trap

134
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,958
to round up these spies.

135
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,250
No. No.
No, no, no, the Firebenders made it clear.

136
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Any resistance and they'll send
everything they've got at us.

137
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,083
[Teo] Let them come.

138
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,375
The Avatar has returned to the world.

139
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,375
It's time to stop hiding.

140
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,875
It's time to fight.

141
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,958
[doors close]

142
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,167
[mysterious music playing]

143
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,625
Your Highness.

144
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,792
Hmm?

145
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,875
The prisoner you requested.

146
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,792
He was caught fighting,
destroying property.

147
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,875
Menacing the people.

148
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,375
And he's an Airbender.

149
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,625
Huh?

150
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:41,292
Lotus root, pine bark, dried jasmine.

151
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,083
Hmm?

152
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,333
Lotus root, pine bark, dried jasmine,

153
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:52,167
scalding hot water,
steeped for two minutes!

154
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:53,958
Tea?

155
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,542
Okay.

156
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,250
And you're wrong about him.

157
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,958
We witnessed the bending...

158
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,375
- Wrong!
- [gasps]

159
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,500
He is not just an Airbender.

160
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
He is the master of all four elements.

161
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,583
The savior of the world.

162
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,208
He is

163
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,250
the Avatar.

164
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,667
[indistinct whispering]

165
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,208

[woman] Is it true he abandoned the siege?

495
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:50,875
Yes, after his son was killed.

496
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,625
So his son dies a hero,
and he'll be forever known as a coward.

497
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,250
Brother, take comfort in knowing
that Lu Ten will forever be hailed

498
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,167
as a champion of the Fire Nation.

499
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,958
Thank you, Ozai.

500
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,833
His sacrifice will be enshrined in legend.

501
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,417
[Zuko] Uncle,

502
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:29,042
what a great honor for you and for Lu Ten

503
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,042
to die in the service of the Fire Nation.

504
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,167
When my studies weren't going well
and Father was unhappy,

505
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,958
Lu Ten gave me this.

506
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:06,917
He had won it
for finishing first in his officer class.

507
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:14,708
He said it should belong
to someone destined to do great things.

508
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,208
It gave me strength.

509
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,375
Lu Ten never needed it

510
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,708
because he was
the strongest person I knew.

511

[uplifting music playing]

512

You're getting good at that.

513
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,208
Practice and some good instruction.

514
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,292
Yeah? From the scroll?

515
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,250
Yeah.

516
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,458
And Jet, he helped me through some things.

517
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,208
He lost family, just like us.

518
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,667
He knows how those memories
can hold you back.

519
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,667
He got me to see
that I'd only been thinking about

520
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,792
how Mom died and not how she lived.

521
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,875
Jet might have gone down the wrong path,
but he was pushed that way.

522
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,500
Just like Sai was.

523
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,375
You know, Sai told me
I should be an engineer.

524
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:09,958
That was my true calling.

But it was nice to hear someone tell me
I had something to offer the world.

Besides my superior fighting skills.

Forget it.

531
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,792
You led the tribe and protected us
with nobody to help you.

532
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,958
Dad never had to bear
that kind of burden alone.

533
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:41,875
You had it harder than him.

Ah, behind these doors
lies a fearsome challenge.

546

A true test of whether or not
you are prepared to be the Avatar.

- Bumi.
- Ah.

548
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,125
All these challenges, games, tests,
none of them make any sense.

Nothing has made sense in a hundred years.

Very clever.

It's all about games with you,
isn't it, Avatar?

00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,375
Who cares about responsibility?

558

Who cares about, oh, saving the world?

559

No. More fun to goof off. Am I right?

00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,042
In this world, you can't rely on anyone,

657
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,250
even your friends.

658
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,417
[grunts]

659
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,125
[grunts]

660
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,375
Especially your friends.

661
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:56,917
[snarls]

662
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,208
- [chuckles]
- [Aang] Ah.

663
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,208
- [grunts]
- [Aang grunts]

664
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,625
[grunts]

665
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:17,250
[grunting]

666
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:20,125
[laughs]

667
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,042
[snorts]

668
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,792
Well, as fun as this has been,

669
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:28,167
it's time for the games to end. [grunts]

670
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,750
[grunts]

671
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,708
[Aang] Ah!

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,375
[chuckles] Huh?

673
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,042
[chuckles]

674
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:51,042
Bumi, I can't hold both of them. Help me!

675
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,125
Let it fall.

676
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,958
Let it fall, and you win.

677
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:58,000
- Bumi, this isn't a game!
- Yes, it is.

678
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:02,167
One that requires you
to make impossible choices.

679
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,292
Do I save this town or that?

680
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:09,292
Who gets the last of the food scraps?
The orphanage or the soldiers?

681
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:12,375
You have to make choices like that

682
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:16,750
day after day, year after year.

683
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:20,667
And that's just to save this one city.

684
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,542
You have to save the whole world.

685
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,917
Let it fall, Aang,

686
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:29,833
and learn what it means to be the Avatar.

687
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:31,625
No!

688
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,708
Then the world is doomed.

689
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,750
[Katara] Sokka, get the king.

690
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:51,458
Huh?

691
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:52,792
- [Sokka grunts]
- [Bumi] Ah!

692
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,167
Aang, now!

693
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,542
[grunts]

694
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:00,167
Are you okay?

695
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:02,375
[Aang panting]

696
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,833
Well, kid, you sure know
how to bring the house down.

697
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:07,500
[grunting]

698
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,792
Cheater! You cheated!

699
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,375
You didn't do it on your own,

700
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:18,708
so you didn't learn anything at all.

701
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,000
[Aang] You were wrong.

702
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:22,333
You can rely on your friends,

703
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,208
and that's the only way
I'm gonna save the world.

704
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,833
With my friends.

705
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,958
You think like a child.

706
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,000
Is that really so bad?

707
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:39,167
Huh?

708
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,833
Remember this?

709
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,417
I use it to call a friend.

710
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:49,292
That's what I'm gonna do now.

711
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:53,708
Call on an old friend.

712
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,208
You were right.

713
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,375
I wasn't here for the world. Or for you.

714
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,792
But I'm here now.

715
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,917
[uplifting music playing]

716
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,667
[man] Your Highness,

717
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,667
we've called up the reinforcements.

718
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,958
And… and…
and you doubled the guards on the walls?

719
00:45:31,042 --> 00:45:34,208
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Good. Tell them I'll be there soon.

720
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:37,292
Wait, what's going on?

721
00:45:38,292 --> 00:45:42,208
Fire Nation forces are on the move.
They'll be here by dawn.

722
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:43,708
You're under attack?

723
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:47,708
We will be, but we will be ready.

724
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,750
Fortunately, a source tipped us off.

725
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,042
Sai?

726
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:57,417
The mechanist alerted the generals
to a network of spies in the city.

727
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,292
Helped us round them up.
Now, all of you get out of here.

728
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:06,625
The Avatar has places he has to be.
We can take care of ourselves.

729
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:10,500
It's time Omashu rejoined the war.

730
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:17,792
Oh, uh, but I do have
one more challenge for you.

731
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,625
[laughing]

732
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:24,208
[adventurous music playing]

733
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,458
[man] My cabbages!

734
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:29,958
[somber music playing]

735
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,958
[Iroh grunting]

736
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,958
Ah. [sighs]

737
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,833
It seems we are always
getting on or off boats.

738
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,667
Perhaps that is our lot in life,
Prince Zuko.

739
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:11,042
[mysterious music playing]

740
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,583
[indistinct chatter]

741
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,917
Ah, good. It's not too late.

742
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,360
- [Zuko] What are you doing here, Uncle?
- [Iroh] Same as you.

743
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:37,250
Getting ready to embark
on what is sure to be a memorable journey.

744
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,125
You wanna come with me?

745
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,667
I've come fully prepared.
All the tea I need.

746
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,792
I don't need a babysitter.

747
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,500
How about a friend?

748
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,125
[sentimental music playing]

749
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,750
My father made it very clear

750
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,458
that I'm not to return
until I find the Avatar…

751
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,458
which means

752
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:21,583
it could be a very long time
before we return home.

753
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:28,042
Home.

754
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:35,250
Everything I need is on this boat.

755
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,542
Like I said, all the tea I need, hmm?

756
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,167
[laughs]

757
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,542
[mysterious music playing]

758
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:07,250
What is it, Zuko?

759
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:09,583
Nothing.

760
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,958
Let's get you home.

761
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:27,000
[dramatic drum and flute music playing]
